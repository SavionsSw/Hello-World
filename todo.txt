Bugs:

-------------------------------TODO--------------------------------

- Dagger attack animations.
- Someone fucked up my level up shit, thus this needs fixing (the flashing icons in the Skills tab).
- Cabbage can't be eaten.
- Home teleport is not interupted by combat.
- Stronghold of security monsters are supposed to be aggressive.
- Make the destroy option actually destroy the items, rather than dropping them.
- Interfaces don't get closed when getting hit, doing an item action(bone burrying), etc.
- Picking up an item while in combat and having auto-retaliate on will stop walking to the 
		item and continue combat when being hit (doesn't do it on rs).
- Teleports don't work.
- Teletabs don't work.
- No altar at home.
- Run energy isn't increasing properly for resting.
- "That player is already in combat" while attacking an NPC in combat.
- Shop randomly switches from eg. general store to aubury's rune store.



-------------------------------FIXED-------------------------------

-	Disable overloads in wilderness (if you still have the effects somehow stop them from entering/end the effects)(done - steve)
-	Combat following is broken (you will stop like 2 squares away) (fixed > MYSTIC FLOW <)
-	Hitting way more than the npc's hp to kill them (fixed - zach)
-	When you first login, and you're in an area with aggressive npcs, and they start attacking you they don't hit you anymore 
		(my guess is something hasn't loaded yet, so it's glitching out). (fixed Mystic Flow')
-	Bonuses are weird, like I can only deal damage to man if I have full bandos & a firecape on 
		(I've looked at this and it seems like you can only hit with a weapon equiped - zach)
-	Some projectile stuff is wrong(no big deal) (kinda fixed)
